everiPixel
==========

This is a fun application of everiToken's `Non Fungible Token` feature.
A canvas of pixels is presented to the user, and each pixel is represented by
a single NFT. Changes to pixels are recorded forever in the blockchain, and
people can actually own the pixel and transfer it.
